# Creating Modules

C2F modules are composed of two main parts. The first of these parts is a Python file which details information relating to the Module such as the Modules name, the Docker Image it uses, and Database tables which will be used to store data reported by the Modules. The second part is the Docker container itself. C2F has an SDK available, allowing developers to easily create wrapper scripts to place inside containers to send reports back to the master node.   


The subsequent sub-chapters will go into more depth as to how to create Modules.
